Goal: Refactor into a modular, maintainable component architecture following React best practices.
Principles:
Single Responsibility: Each component should have one clear purpose
Separation of Concerns: Types, hooks, utilities, and UI components in separate files
Reusability: Extract shared patterns into reusable components
Colocation: Keep related files together in the same directory
